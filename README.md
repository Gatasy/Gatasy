# 👋 Hi, I'm Chen Jiayu

🎓 I'm currently a student at Lanzhou University (LZU), majoring in Computer Science.

🔬 My research interests include:
- C language design and systems programming
- Operating system internals and kernel module development
- Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion-based generative models

💻 I enjoy building from scratch, understanding low-level system behavior, and exploring the mathematical principles behind modern AI models.
